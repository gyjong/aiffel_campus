       " Document(page_content='Foreword \\nThe International Convention forthe Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS), as amended , deals with various aspects of maritime \\nsafety and contains in chapter VII the mandatory provisions governing the carriage of dangerous goods in packaged form \\n。rin solid form in bulk. The carriage of dangerous goods is prohibited except in accordance with the relevant provisions of \\nchapter VII, which are amplified by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code. \\nRegulation 11-2/19 of the SOLAS Convention , as amended , specifies the special requirements for a ship intended to carry \\ndangerous goods, the keel of which was laid or which was at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 July 2002. \\nThe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating \\nthereto (MARPOL) , deals with various aspects of prevention of marine pollution, and contains in its Annex 111 the mandatory \\nprovisions for the prevention of p이lution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form. Regulation 1(2) prohibits \\nthe carriage of harmful substances in ships except in accordance with the provisions of Annex 111, which are also amplified \\nby the IMDG Code. \\nIn accordance with the Provisions concerning Reports on Incidents Involving Harmful Substances (Protocoll to MARPOL) , \\nincidents involving losses of such substances from ships must be reported by the master or other person having charge \\nof the ship concerned. \\nThe IMDG Code that was adopted by resolution A.716(17) and amended by amendments 27 to 30 was recommended to \\nGovernments for adoption or for use as the basis for national regulations in pursuance of their obligations under regulation \\nVII/1.4 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention , as amended , and regulation 1(3) of Annex 111 of MARPOL. The IMDG Code, as \\namended , attained mandatory status from 1 January 2004 under the umbrella of SOLAS; however, some parts of the \\nCode continue to be recommendatory. Observance of the Code harmonizes the practices and procedures followed in the \\ncarriage of dangerous goods by sea and ensures compliance with the mandatory provisions of the SOLAS Convention and \\nof Annex 111 of MARPOL. \\nThe COde, which sets out in detail the requirements applicable to each individual substance , material or article, has \\nundergone many changes, in both layout and content, in order to keep pace with the expansion and progress of industry. \\n1M。’sMaritime Safety Committee (MSC) is authorized by the Organization’s Assembly to adopt amendments to the Code, \\nthus enabling IMO to respond promptly to developments in transport. \\nThe MSC at its ninety-ninth session agreed that, in order to facilitate the multimodal transport of dangerous goods, the \\nprovisions of the IMDG Code, 2018 edition, may be applied from 1 January 2019 on a voluntary basis, pending their official \\nentry into force on 1 January 2020 without any transitional period.

       " Document(page_content='Preamble \\nCarriage of dangerous goods by sea is regulated in order to reasonably prevent injury to persons or damage \\nto ships and their cargoes. Carriage of marine pollutants is primarily regulated to prevent harm to the marine \\nenvironmen t. The objective of the IMDG Code is to enhance the safe carriage of dangerous goods while \\nfacilitating the free unrestricted movement of such goods and prevent p이lution to the environmen t. \\n2 Over the years, many maritime countries have taken measures to regulate the transport of dangerous goods \\nby sea. The various regulations , codes and practices , however, differed in their framework and, in particular , \\nin the identification and labelling of such goods. 80th the terminology used and the provisions for packaging \\nand stowage varied from country to country and created difficulties for all directly or indirectly concerned with \\nthe transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\n3 The need for international regulation of the transport of dangerous goods by sea was recognized by the 1929 \\nInternational Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which recommended that rules on the subject \\nhave international effect. The classification of dangerous goods and certain general provisions concerning \\ntheir transport in ships were adopted by the 1948 SOLAS Conference. This Conference also recommended \\nfurther study with the object of developing international regulations. \\n4 Meanwhile, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations had appointed an ad hoc Committee \\n。fExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Committee of Experts), which had been actively \\nconsidering the international aspect of the transport of dangerous goods by all modes of transport. This \\ncommittee completed a report in 1956 dealing with classification , listing and labelling of dangerous goods \\nand with the transport documents required for such goods. This report, with subsequent modifications , \\noffered a general framework to which existing regulations could be harmonized and within which they could \\nbe further developed. The primary goal being world-wide uniformity for regulations concerning the transport \\nof dangerous goods by sea as well as other modes of transport. \\n5 As a further step towards meeting the need for international rules governing the transport of dangerous \\ngoods in ships, the 1960 SOLAS Conference , in addition to laying down a general framework of provisions \\nin chapter VII of the SOLAS Convention , invited IMO (Recommendation 56) to undertake a study with a view \\nto establishing a unified international code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea. This study would \\nbe pursued in cooperation with the UN Committee of Experts and should take account of existing maritime \\npractices and procedures. The Conference further recommended that the unified code be prepared by IMO \\nand that it be adopted by the Governments that were Parties to the 1960 Convention. \\n6 To implement Recommendation 56, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) appointed a working group \\ndrawn from those countries having considerable experience in the transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\nPreliminary drafts for each class of substances , materials and articles were subsequently brought under \\nclose scrutiny by the working group to take into account throughout the practices and procedures of a number \\n。fmaritime countries in order to make the Code as widely acceptable as possible. This new International \\nMaritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code was approved by the MSC and recommended to Governments by \\nthe Assembly of IMO in 1965. \\n7 During anotherSOLAS Conference held in 1974, chapterVl1 ofthe Convention remained essentially unchanged. \\nSince that date, several amendments to chapter VII adopted by the MSC have entered into force. Although \\ninvoked by a footnote reference in regulation 1 of chapter VII, the IMDG Code itself had only recommendatory \\nstatus until 31 December 2003. \\n8 At the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973, the need was recognized to preserve the marine \\nenvironmen t. It was further recognized that negligent or accidental release of marine pollutants transported \\nby sea in packaged form should be minimized. Consequently , provisions were established and adopted by \\nthe Conference , and are contained in Annex 111 of the Internationa l Convention for the Prevention of Pollution \\nfrom Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPO 니. The Marine Environment \\nProtection Committee (MEPC) decided in 1985 that Annex 111 should be implemented through the IMDG Code. \\nThis decision was also endorsed by the MSC in 1985. Since that date, several amendments to Annex 111 t。\\nMARPOL have entered into force. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18) XIII', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Preamble \\n9 The UN Committee of Experts has continued to meet until the present day and its published Recommendations \\non the Transport of Dangerous Goods are updated biennially. In 1996, the MSC agreed that the IMDG Code \\nshould be reformatted consistent with the format of the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous \\nGoods. The consistency in format of the UN Recommendations , the IMDG Code and other dangerous goods \\ntransport regulations is intended to enhance user-friendliness , compliance with the regulations , and the safe \\ntransport of dangerous goods. \\n10 In 2002, the MSC adopted amendments to SOLAS chapter 씨 I to makethe IMDG Code mandatory, which came \\ninto force on 1 January 2004. Since then, further amendments were adopted to facilitate user friendliness \\nand promote uniform implementation of the Code. In addition, at its ninety-ninth session in May 2018, the \\nMSC adopted amendment 39-18 to the mandatory IMDG Code, which will enter into force on 1 January 2020 \\nwithout any transitional period. However, in accordance with resolution MSC.442(99), Governments were \\nencouraged to apply this amendment in whole or on part on a voluntary basis from 1 January 2019. \\n11 In order to keep the Code up to date from the maritime transport operational aspect, the MSC will continue \\nto take into account technological developments , as well as changes to chemical classifications and the \\nrelated consignment provisions that primarily concern the shipper/consignor. The two-year periodicity of \\namendments to the UN Recommendations on Transport of Dangerous Goods will also provide the source of \\nmost future updating of the IMDG Code. \\n12 The MSC will also have regard to future implications for the carriage of dangerous goods by sea, in particular , \\narising from any acceptance by the UN Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED) of common \\ncriteria for the classification of chemicals on the basis of a Global Harmonization System (GHS). \\n13 Attention is drawn to IMO document FAL.6/Circ.14, a list of existing publications relevant to areas and topics \\nrelating to ship/port interface matters. \\n14 Advice on emergency procedures and for initial management of chemical poisoning and diagnosis that may \\nbe used in conjunction with the IMDG Code is published separately in The EmS Guide: Revised Emergency \\nResponse Procedures for Ships Carrying Dangerous Goods (MSC.1/Circ.1025 as amended by MSC.1/ \\nCirc.1025/Add.1 , MSC. \\nxiv IMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

These provisions are based on the IAEA Regulations for the Safe \\nTransport of Radioactive Material, 2012 Edition, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSR-6, IAEA, Vienna \\n(201킹. Explanatory material can be found in Advisory Material for the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport \\n。fRadioactive Material (2012 Edition), IAEA Safety Standards Series No. SSG-26, IAEA, ψenna (2014). \\n1.5.1.2 The objective of this Code is to establish provisions that shall be satisfied to ensure safety and to protect \\npersons, property and the environment from the effects of radiation in the transport of radioactive material. \\nThis protection is achieved by requiring: \\n.1 contaínment of the radioactive contents; \\n.2 control of external radiation levels; \\n.3 prevention of criticalíty; and \\n.4 prevention of damage caused by heat. \\nThese provisions are satisfied firstly by applying a graded approach to contents limits for packages and \\nconveyances and to performance standards applied to package designs depending upon the hazard of the \\nradioactive contents. Secondly , they are satísfied by ímposing conditions on the design and operation of \\npackages and on the maintenance of packagings , including a consideration of the nature of the radioactive \\ncontents. Finally, they are satisfied by requiring adminístrative controls including , where appropriate, approval \\nby competent authorities . \\n1.5.1.3 The provisions of this Code apply to the transport of radioactive material by sea, including transport which \\nis incidental to the use of the radioactive material.

However, the competent authorities \\nretain the right by mutual agreement to approve transport of explosive substances and articles for special \\npurposes under special conditions. Therefore entries have been included in the Dangerous Goods List for \\n“Substances , explosive , not otherwise specified\" and “Articles, explosive , not otherwise specified\" . It is \\nintended that these entries should only be used when no other method of operation is possible. \\nNote 2: General entries such as “Explosive , blasting, type A\" are used to allow for the transport of new substances. \\nIn preparing these provisions , military ammunition and explosives have been taken into consideration to the \\nextent that they are likely to be transported by commercial carriers. \\nNote 3: A number of substances and articles in class 1 are described in appendix B. These descriptions are given \\nbecause a term may not be well-known or may be at variance with its usage for regulatory purposes . \\nNote 4: Class 1 is unique in that the type of packaging frequently has a decisive effect on the hazard and therefore on \\nthe assignment to a particular division. The correct division is determined by use of the procedures provided \\nin this chapter. \\n2.1.1 Definitions and general provisions \\n2.1.1.1 Class 1 comprises: \\n.1 explosive substances (a substance which is not itself an explosive but which can form an explosive \\natmosphere of gas, vapour or dust is not included in class 1), except those which are too dangerous to \\ntransport or those where the predominant hazard is one appropriate to another class; \\n.2 explosive articles, except devices containing explosive substances in such quantity or of such a \\ncharacter that their inadvertent or accidental ignition or initiation during transport shall not cause any \\neffect external to the device either by projection , fire, smoke, heat or loud noise (see 2.1.3.4); and \\n6.3 substances and articles not mentioned under .1 and .2 which are manufactured with a view to producing \\na practical explosive or pyrotechnic effect. \\n2.1.1.2 Transport of explosive substances which are unduly sensitive, or so reactive as to be subject to spontaneous \\nreaction, is prohibited. \\n2.1.1.3 Definitions \\n50 For the purposes of this Code, the following definitions apply: \\n.1 Explosive substance means a solid or liquid substance (or a mixture of substances) which is in itself \\ncapable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed \\nas to cause damage to the surroundings. Pyrotechnic substances are included even when they do not \\nevolve gases . \\n. 2 Pyrotechnic substance means a substance or a mixture of substances designed to produce an effect by \\nheat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of these as the result of non-detonative self-sustaining \\nexothermic chemical reactions \\n.3 Explosive article means an article containing one or more explosive substances . \\n.4 Mass explosion means one which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously . \\n. 5 Phlegmatized means that a substance (or “phlegmatizer\") has been added to an explosive to enhance its \\nsafety in handling and transpor t. The phlegmatizer renders the explosive insensitive , or less sensitive, to \\nthe following actions: heat, shock, impact, percussion or friction. Typical phlegmatizing agents include, \\nbut are not limited to: wax, paper, water, polymers (such as chlorofluoropolymers) , alcohol and oils (such \\nas petroleum jelly and paraffin). \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

The effects are largely confined to the package and no \\nprojection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not \\ncause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package. \\nNote: Substances and articles in this division are in compatibility group S if they are s。\\npackaged or designed that any hazardous effects arising from the accidental functioning are \\nconfined within the package unless the package has been degraded by fire, in which case \\nall blast or projection effects are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder fire \\nfighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package. \\nDivision 1.5 Very insensitive substances which have a mass explosion hazard \\nThis division comprises substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive \\nthat there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under \\nnormal conditions of transport. \\nNote: The probability of transition from burning to detonation is greater when large quantities \\nare transported in a ship. As a consequence , the stowage provisions for explosive substances \\nin division 1.1 and for those in division 1.5 are identical. \\nOivision 1.6 Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard \\nThis division comprises articles which predominantly contain extremely insensitive substances \\nand which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. \\nD Note: The hazard from articles of division 1.6 is limited to the explosion of a single article. \\n2.1.1.5 Any substance or article having or suspected of having explosive characteristics shall first be considered for \\nclassification in class 1 in accordance with the procedures in 2.1.3. Goods are not classified in class 1 when: \\n.1 unless specially authorized , the transport of an explosive substance is prohibited because sensitivity of \\nthe substance is excessive; \\n.2 the substance or article comes within the scope of those explosive substances and articles which are \\nspecifically excluded from class 1 by the definition of this class; or \\n.3 the substance or article has no explosive properties. \\n2.1.2 Compatibility groups and classification codes \\n2.1.2.1 Goods of class 1 are considered to be “compatible\" if they can be safely stowed or transported together \\nwithout significantly increasing either the probability of an accident or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of \\nthe effects of such an accident. By this criterion, goods listed in this class have been divided into a number \\nof compatibility groups, each denoted by a letter from A to L (excluding 1), N and S.

It gives a measure of the risk of formation of explosive or ignitable mixtures when \\nthe liquid escapes from its packing. A flammable liquid cannot be ignited so long as its temperature remains \\nbelow the flashpoint. \\nNote: 00 not confuse the flashpoint with the ignition temperature , which is the temperature to which an \\nexplosive vapour-air mixture must be heated to cause actual explosion. There is no relationship between the \\nflashpoint and the ignition temperature. \\n2.3.3.2 The flashpoint is not an exact physical constant for a given liquid. It depends to some extent on the construction \\nof the test apparatus used and on the testing procedure. Therefore , when providing flashpoint data, specify \\nthe name of the test apparatus. \\n2.3.3.3 Several standard apparatuses are in current use. They all operate on the same principle: a specified quantity \\nof the liquid is introduced into a receptacle at a temperature well below the flashpoint to be expected , then \\nslowly heated; periodically , a small flame is brought near to the surface of the liquid. The flashpoint is the \\nlowest temperature at which a “flash\" is observed. \\n2.3.3.4 The test methods can be divided into two groups, depending on the use in an apparatus of an open receptacle \\n(open-cup methods) or a closed one which is only opened to admit the flame (closed-cup methods). As a rule, \\nthe flashpoints found in an open-cup test are a few degrees higher than in a closed-cup test. \\n2.3.3.5 In general, reproducibility in closed-cup apparatus is better than in open-cup. \\n2.3.3.5.1 It is therefore recommended that flashpoints , especially in the range around 230C, shall be determined by \\nmeans of closed-cup (c.c) methods. \\n2.3.3.5.2 Flashpoint data in this Code are generally based on closed-cup methods. In countries where it is customary \\nto determine flashpoints by the open-cup method, the temperatures given by that method would need to be \\nreduced to correspond with those in this Code. \\n2.3.3.6 Oetermination of flashpoint \\n66 The following methods for determining the flashpoint of flammable liquids may be used: \\nInternational standards: \\nISO 1516 \\nISO 1523 \\nISO 2719 \\nISO 13736 \\nISO 3679 \\nISO 3680 \\nNational standards: \\nAmerican Society for Testing Materials International , 100 Barr Harbor Orive, PO Box C700, \\nWest Conshohocken , Pennsylvania , USA 19428-2959: \\nASTM 03828-07a , Standard Test Methods for Flash Point by Small Scale Closed Cup Tester \\nASTM 056-05, Standard Test Method for Flash Point by Tag Closed Cup Tester \\nASTM 03278-96(2004)e , Standard Test Methods for Flash Point of Liquids by Small Scale Closed-Cup \\nApparatus \\nASTM 093-08, Standard Test Methods for Flash Point by Pensky-Martens Closed Cup Tester \\nAssociation française de normalisation , AFNOR, 11, rue Francis de Pressensé , 93571 La Plaine Saint-Oenis \\nCedex: \\nFrench Standard NF M 07-019 \\nFrench Standards NF M 07-011/NF T 30-050/NF T 66-009 \\nFrench Standard NF M 07-036 \\nOeutsches Institut für Normung , Burggrafenstr. 6, 0-10787 Berlin: \\nStandard OIN 51755 (flashpoints below 650C) \\nState Committee of the Council of Ministers for Standardization , 113813, GSP, Moscow, \\nM-49 Leninsky Prospect, 9: \\nGOST 12.1.044-84 \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 78}),\n",

The danger may come not only from the fire but also from toxic combustion products. Metal \\npowders are especially dangerous because of the difficulty of extinguishing a fire, since normal extinguishing \\nagents such as carbon dioxide or water can increase the hazard. \\n2.4.2.2.2 Classification of flammable solids \\n2.4.2.2.2.1 Powdered , granular or pasty substances shall be classified as readily combustible solids of class 4.1 when \\nthe time of burning of one or more of the test runs, performed in accordance with the test method described \\nin the Manual of Tests and Criteria, part 川，33.2.1, is less than 45 s or the rate of burning is more than \\n2.2 mm/s.

If so, this fact is \\nmentioned in the Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3.2 in the wording “vapour irritates mucous membranes\". \\n2.8.1.2.3 A few substances may produce toxic gases when decomposed by very high temperatures. In these cases the \\nstatement “when involved in a fire, evolves toxic gases\" appears in the Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3.2. \\n2.8.1.2.4 In addition to direct destructive action in contact with skin or mucous membranes , some substances in this \\nclass are toxic or harmful. Poisoning may result if they are swallowed , or if their vapour is inhaled; some of \\nthem even may penetrate the skin. Where appropriate , a statement is made to that effect in the Dangerous \\nGoods List in chapter 3.2. \\n2.8.1.2.5 AII substances in this class have a more or less destructive effect on materials such as metals and textiles. \\n2.8.1.2.5.1 In the Dangerous Goods List, the term “corrosive to most metals\" means that any metal likely to be present \\nin a ship, or in its cargo, may be attacked by the substance or its vapour. \\n2.8.1.2.5.2 The term “corrosive to aluminium , zinc, and tin\" implies that iron or steel is not damaged in contact with the \\nsubstance. \\n2.8.1.2.5.3 A few substances in this class can corrode glass, earthenware and other siliceous materials. Where \\nappropriate , this is stated in the Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3.2. \\n2.8.1.2.6 Many substances in this class only become corrosive after having reacted with water, or with moisture in \\nthe air. This fact is indicated in the Dangerous Goods List in chapter 3.2 by the words “in the presence of \\nmoisture ... \". The reaction of water with many substances is accompanied by the liberation of irritating and \\ncorrosive gases. Such gases usually become visible as fumes in the air. \\n2.8.1.2.7 A few substances in this class generate heat in reaction with water or organic materials, including wood, \\npaper, fibres, some cushioning materials and certain fats and oils.

In itself, therefore, the marks do not necessarily confirm that the packaging may be \\nused for any substance. The type of packaging (such as steel drum), its maximum capacity or mass, and any \\nspecial provisions are specified for each substance or article in part 3 of this Code. \\nNote 2: The marks are intended to be of assistance to packaging manufacturers , reconditioners , packaging \\nusers, carriers and regulatory authorities. In relation to the use of a new packaging , the original marks are a \\nmeans for its manufacturer to identify the type and to indicate those performance test provisions that have \\nbeen met. \\nNote 3: The marks do not always provide full details of the test levels, etc., and these may need to be taken \\nfurther into account, such as by reference to a test certificate , test reports or register of successfully tested \\npackagings. For example, a packaging having an X or Y mark may be used for substances to which a packing \\ngroup having a lesser degree of danger has been assigned, with the relevant maximum permissible value \\n。fthe relative density* determined by taking into account the factor 1.5 or 2.25 indicated in the packaging \\ntest provisions in 6.1.5 as appropriate , i.e. packing group 1 packaging tested for products of relative density \\n1.2 could be used as a packing group 11 packaging for products of relative density 1.8 or packing group 111 \\npackaging of relative density 2.7, provided, of course, that all the performance criteria can still be met with the \\nproduct having the higher relative density. \\n6.1.3.1 Each packaging intended for use according to this Code shall bear marks which are durable, legible and \\nplaced in such a location and of such a size relative to the packaging as to be readily visible. For packages \\nwith a gross mass of more than 30 kg, the marks or a duplicate thereof shall appear on the top or on a side of \\nthe packaging. Letters, numerals and symbols shall be at least 12 mm high, except for packagings of 30 L or \\n30 kg capacity or less, when they shall be at least 6 mm in height, and for packagings of 5 L or 5 kg or less, \\nwhen they shall be of an appropriate size. \\nThe marks shall show: \\nru、\\n(a) The United Nati。빼 ackaging symbol: \\\\... n ) \\nThis symbol shall not be used for any purpose other than certifying that a packaging , a flexible bulk \\ncontainer, a portable tank or a MEGC complies with the relevant requirements in chapters 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, \\n6.6,6.7 or 6.9.

In addition, the package shall be so designed that it can be properly secured in or on the \\nconveyance during transport. \\nThe design shall be such that any lifting attachments on the package will not fail when used in the intended \\nmanner and that, if failure of the attachments shall occur, the ability of the package to meet other provisions of \\nthis Code would not be impaired. The design shall take account of appropriate safety factors to cover snatch \\nlifting. \\nAttachments and any other features on the outer surface of the package which could be used to lift it shall \\nbe designed either to support its mass in accordance with the provisions of 6.4.2.2 or shall be removable or \\notherwise rendered incapable of being used during transport. \\nAs far as practicable , the packaging shall be so designed and finished that the external surfaces are free from \\nprotruding features and can be easily decontaminated. \\nAs far as practicable , the outer layer of the package shall be so designed as to prevent the collection and the \\nretention of water. \\nAny features added to the package at the time of transport which are not part of the package shall not reduce \\nits safety. \\nThe package shall be capable of withstanding the effects of any acceleration , vibration or vibration resonance \\nwhich may arise under routine conditions of transport without any deterioration in the effectiveness of the \\nclosing devices on the various receptacles or in the integrity of the package as a whole. In partic비ar， nuts, \\nbolts and other securing devices shall be so designed as to prevent them from becoming loose or being \\nreleased unintentionally, even after repeated use. \\nThe materials of the packaging and any components or structures shall be physically and chemically \\ncompatible with each other and with the radioactive contents. Account shall be taken of their behaviour under \\nirradiation. \\nAII valves through which the radioactive contents could escape shall be protected against unauthorized \\noperation. \\nThe design of the package shall take into account ambient temperatures and pressures that are likely to be \\nencountered in routine conditions of transport. \\nA package shall be so designed that it provides sufficient shielding to ensure that, under routine conditions of \\ntransport and with the maximum radioactive contents that the package is designed to contain, the radiation \\nlevel at any point on the external surface of the package would not exceed the values specified in 2.7.2.4.1.2, \\n4.1.9.1.11 and 4.1.9.1.12, as applicable , with account taken of 7.1.4.5.3.3 and 7.1.4.5.5. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 362}),\n",

A magazine that is not a fixed \\npart of the ship shall meet the provisions for a closed cargo transport unit for class 1 (see 7.1.2). A magazine \\nthat is a fixed part of the ship such as compartment , below deck area or hold shall meet the provisions \\nof 7.6.2.4. \\nNote 2: Cargo holds cannot be interpreted as closed cargo transport units. \\nClear of lívíng quarters means that packages or cargo transport units shall be stowed a minimum distance of \\n3 m from accommodation , air intakes, machinery spaces and other enclosed work areas. \\nClosed cargo transport unít forc/ass 1 means a unit which fully encloses the contents by permanent structures , \\ncan be secured to the ship’s structure and is, except for division 1.4, structurally serviceable as defined in this \\nsection. Cargo transport units with fabric sides or tops are not closed cargo transport units. The floor of any \\nclosed cargo transport unit shall either be constructed of wood, close-boarded , or so arranged that goods \\nare stowed on sparred gratings, wooden pallets or dunnage. \\nCombustible material means material which may or may not be dangerous goods but which is easily ignited \\nand supports combustion. Examples of combustible materials include wood, paper, straw, vegetable fibres, \\nproducts made from such materials, coal, lubricants , and oils. This definition does not apply to packaging \\nmaterial or dunnage. \\nPotential sources of ignition means, but is not limited to, open fires, machinery exhausts, galley uptakes, \\nelectrical outlets and electrical equipment including those on refrigerated or heated cargo transport units \\nunless they are of certified safe type. * \\nProtected from sources of heat means that packages and cargo transport units shall be stowed at least 2.4 m \\nfrom heated ship structures , where the surface temperature is liable to exceed 550C. Examples of heated \\nstructures are steam pipes, heating coils, top or side walls of heated fuel and cargo tanks, and bulkheads of \\nmachinery spaces. In addition, packages not loaded inside a cargo transport unit and stowed on deck shall \\nbe shaded from direct sunlight. The surface of a cargo transport unit can heat rapidly when in direct sunlight \\nin nearly windless conditions and the cargo may also become heated. Depending on the nature of the goods \\nin the cargo transport unit and the planned voyage precautions shall be taken to ensure that exposure t。\\ndirect sunlight is reduced. \\nStowage means the proper placement of dangerous goods on board a ship in order to ensure safety and \\nenvironmental protection during transport. \\nStowage on deck means stowage on the weather deck. For open ro-ro cargo spaces see 7.5.2.6. \\nStowage under deck means any stowage that is not on the weathe \\nStructurally serviceable for class 1 means the cargo transport unit shall not have major defects in its structural \\ncomponents , e.g. top and bottom rails, top and bottom end rails, door sill and header, floor cross-members , \\ncorner posts, and corner fittings in a freight container. Major defects are: dents or bends in the structural \\n• For cargo spaces, refer to SOLAS 11-2/19.3.2 and for refrigerated or heated cargo transport units refer to Recommendations \\npublished by the International Electrotechnical Commission , in particular IEC 60079. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18) 453', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 465}),\n",

Segregation is obtained by maintaining certain distances between incompatible dangerous \\ngoods or by requiring the presence of one or more steel bulkheads or decks between them, or a combination \\nthereof. Intervening spaces between such dangerous goods may be filled with other cargo compatible with \\nthe dangerous substances or articles in question. \\n7.2.2.2 Segregation terms \\nThe following segregation terms that are used throughout this Code are defined in other chapters of this part \\nas they apply to packing cargo transport units and segregation on board different ship types: \\n.1 “away from\"; \\n.2 “separated from\"; \\n.3 ‘“‘닐separat 언ed by a c。이mp이le하te compar 야tment 。 αrho이|띠df付rom\" \\n.4 ‘“‘\\'separ떠at엄edloαng itu띠d미ina허lIy by an intervening comp미le앙te cαor까)mpar야tment 。야r ho이|띠d f什rom ’\\nSegregat ion terms such as “away from class ... \" that are used in the Dangerous Goods List, “class ... \" is \\ndeemed to include: \\n.1 허1 substances within “class ... \"; and \\n6..2 all substances for which a subsidiary hazard label of “class ... \" is required. \\n7.2.3 Segregation provisions \\n7.2.3.1 To determine the segregation requirements between two or more dangerous goods, the segregation \\nprovisions, including the segregation table (7.2.4) and column 16b of the Dangerous Goods List shall be \\nconsulted , see also the annex to this chapter.

The cargo transport unit shall be constructed in such a way as t。\\nprevent the loss of contents. Where appropriate , the cargo transport unit shall be fitted with devices to facilitate \\nsecuring and handling of the dangerous goods. The cargo transport units shall be adequately maintained. \\n7.3.2.2 Unless otherwise specified, the applicable provisions of the International Convention for Safe \\nContainers (CSC) 1972,\\' as amended , shall be followed for the use of any cargo transport unit which meets \\nthe definition of a “container\" within the terms of that Convention. \\n7.3.2.3 The International Convention for Safe Containers does not apply to offshore containers that are handled in \\nopen seas. The design and testing of offshore containers shall take into account the dynamic lifting and impact \\nforces that may occur when a container is handled in open seas in adverse weather and sea conditions. The \\nrequirements for such containers shall be determined by the approving competent authority. Such provisions \\nshould be based on MSC/Circ.860 Guidelines for the Approval of Offshore Containers handled in Open Seas. \\nSuch containers shall be clearly marked with the words “OFFSHORE CONTAINER\" on the safety approval \\nplate. \\n7.3.3 Packing of cargo transport units t \\n7.3.3.1 Prior to the use of a cargo transport unit it shall be checked to ensure that it is apparently fit for its intended \\npurpose.T \\n7.3.3.2 The interior and exterior of a cargo transport unit shall be inspected prior to loading to ensure that there is no \\ndamage that could affect its integrity or that of the packages to be loaded in it. \\n7.3.3.3 Packages shall be examined and any found to be damaged, leaking or sifting shall not be packed into a \\ncargo transport unit. Care shall be taken to see that excessive water, snow, ice or foreign matter adhering t。\\npackages is removed before packing into a cargo transport unit. Whenever the handling provision “keep as dry \\nas reasonably practicable\" (H1) is assigned in column 16a of the Dangerous Goods List, the cargo transport unit \\nincluding any contained goods, securing or packing materials shall be kept as dry as reasonably practicable. \\n7.3.3.4 Drums containing dangerous goods shall always be stowed in an upright position unless otherwise authorized \\nby the competent authority. \\n7.3.3.5 Cargo transport units shall be loaded in accordance with 7.3.4, so that incompatible dangerous or other \\ngoods are segregated.

Appropriate guidelines for such provisions are contained in the International \\nAtomic Energy Agency’s document Planning and Preparing for Emergency Response to Transport Accidents \\ninvolving Radioactive Materia/, Safety Standard Series No. TS-G-1.2 (ST-3), IAEA, Vienna (2002). \\nAttention is drawn to the latest versions of both The EmS Guide: Revised Emergency Response Procedures for \\nShips Carryíng Dangerous Goods and the Medical First Aid Guide for Use in Accidents Involving Dangerous \\nGoods (MFAG). \\nEmergency response procedures should take into account the formation of other dangerous substances that \\nmay result from the reaction between the contents of a consignment and the environment in the event of an \\naccident. \\nIn the event of a package containing radioactive material suffering from breakage or leakage while the ship \\nis in port, the port authorities should be informed and advice obtained from them or from the competent \\nauthority. * Procedures have been drawn up in many countries for summoning radiological assistance in any \\nsuch emergency. \\nGeneral fire precautions \\nThe prevention of fire in a cargo of dangerous goods is achieved by practising good seamansh ip, observing \\nin particular the following precautions: \\n.1 keep combustible material away from ignition sources; \\n.2 protect a flammable substance by adequate packing; \\n.3 reject damaged or leaking packages; \\n.4 stow packages protected from accidental damage or heating; \\n.5 segregate packages from substances liable to start or spread fire; \\n.6 where appropriate and practicable , stow dangerous goods in an accessible position so that packages in \\nthe vicinity of a fire may be protected; \\n.7 enforce prohibition of smoking in dangerous areas and display clearly recognizable “NO SMOKING\" \\nnotices or signs; and \\n.8 the dangers from short-circuits , earth leakages or sparking will be apparent. Lighting and power cables \\nand fittings should be maintained in good condition. Cables or equipment found to be unsafe should be \\ndisconnected . Where a bulkhead is required to be suitable for segregation purposes , cables and conduit \\npenetrations of the decks and bulkheads should be sealed against the passage of gas and vapours. \\n• Reference is made to chapter 7.9 and the IAEA list of national competent authorities responsible for approvals and authorizations in \\nrespect of the transport of radioactive material. The list is updated annually. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18) 497', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 509}),\n",

If such spaces are not protected by a fixed fire-extinguishing system, they should be accessible for \\nfire-fighting operations. \\n7.8.6.3 No repair work should be carried out in a compartment containing goods of class 1. Special care should be \\nexercised in carrying out repairs in any adjacent space. No welding, burning, cutting, or riveting operations \\ninvolving the use of fire, flame, spark, or arc-producing equipment should be carried out in any space other \\nthan machinery spaces and workshops where fire-extinguishing arrangements are available, except in any \\nemergency and, if in port, with prior authorization of the port authority. \\n7.8.7 Special fire precautions for class 2 \\n7.8.7.1 Effective ventilation should be provided to remove any leakage of gas from within the cargo space or spaces, \\nbearing in mind that some gases are heavier than air and may accumulate in dangerous concentrations in the \\nlower part of the ship \\n7.8.7.2 Measures should be taken to prevent leaking gases from penetrating into any other part of the ship. \\n7.8.7.3 If there is any reason to suspect leakage of a gas, entry into cargo spaces or other enclosed spaces should \\nnot be permitted until the master or responsible officer has taken all safety considerations into account and \\nis satisfied that it is safe to do so. Emergency entry under other circumstances should only be undertaken by \\ntrained crew wearing self-contained breathing apparatus , and protective clothing when recommended , and \\nalways under the supervision of a responsible officer. \\n7.8.7.4 Leakage from pressure receptacles containing flammable gases may give rise to explosive mixtures with air. \\nSuch mixtures, if ignited, may result in explosion and fire. \\n7.8.8 Special fire precautions for class 3 \\n7.8.8.1 Flammable liquids give offflammable vapours which , especially in an enclosed space, form explosive mixtures \\nwith air. Such vapours, if ignited, may cause a “flashback\" to the place in which the substances are stowed. \\nDue regard should be paid to the provision of adequate ventilation to prevent accumulation of vapours. \\n7.8.9 Special fire precautions and fire fighting for class 7 \\n7.8.9.1 The radioactive contents of Excepted , Industrial, and Type A packages are so restricted that, in the event of \\nan accident and damage to the package, there is a high probability that any material released, or shielding \\nefficiency lost, would not give rise to such radiological hazard as to hamper fire-fighting or rescue operations. \\n7.8.9.2 Type B(U) packages , Type B(M) packages and Type C packages are designed to be strong enough to \\nwithstand severe fire without significant loss of contents or dangerous loss of radiation shielding. \\n498 IMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 510}),\n",

Since it is not practical to include a separate entry for every chemical substance or article \\nof commercial importance specifically by name, especially names for mixtures and solutions of various \\nchemical constituents and concentrations , the Dangerous Goods List also includes generic or “not otherwise \\nspecified\" names (e.g. EXTRACTS , FLAVOURING , LlQUID, UN 끼97 or FLAMMABLE LlQUID, N.O.S., UN \\n1993). On this basis, the Dangerous Goods List is intended to include an appropriate name or entry for any \\ndangerous good which may be transported. \\nWhere a dangerous good is specifically listed by name in the Dangerous Goods List, it shall be transported in \\naccordance with the provisions in the 니st which are appropriate for that dangerous good. A generic or “not \\notherwise specified\" entry may be used to permit the transport of substances , materials or articles which do \\nnot appear specifically by name in the Dangerous Goods List. Such a dangerous good may be transported \\nonly after its dangerous properties have been determined. Dangerous goods shall be classified according to \\nthe class definitions , tests and criteria. The name which most appropriately describes the dangerous goods \\nshall be used. Only when the specific name of the dangerous goods does not appear in the Dangerous Goods \\nList or the associated primary or subsidiary hazards assigned to it are not appropriate may a generic or “not \\notherwise specified\" name be used. The classification shall be made by the shipper/consignor or by the \\nappropriate competent authority where so specified in the Code. Once the class of the dangerous good has \\nbeen so established , all conditions for transport , as provided in this Code, shall be met. Any dangerous good \\nhaving or suspected of having explosive characteristics shall first be considered for inclusion in class 1. Some \\ncollective entries may be of the generic or “not otherwise specified\" type provided that the Code contains \\nprovisions ensuring safety, both by excluding extremely dangerous goods from normal transport and by \\ncovering all subsidiary hazards inherent in some goods. \\nInherent instability in goods may take different dangerous forms, for example explosion , polymerization with \\nintense evolution of heat or emission of flammable , toxic, corrosive or asphyxiant gases. The Dangerous \\nGoods List indicates that certain dangerous goods, or dangerous goods in a specific form, concentration or \\nstate, are prohibited for transport by sea. This means that the goods specified are not suitable for transport \\nby sea under normal conditions of transport. This does not mean that such goods may not be transported \\nunder any circumstances. For most goods, such inherent instability can be controlled by suitable packaging , \\ndilution, stabilization , addition of an inhibitor, temperature control or other measures. \\nWhere precautionary measures are laid down in the Dangerous Goods List in respect of a given dangerous \\ngood (such as that it shall be “stabilized\" or “with x% water or phlegmatizer\") , such dangerous good may \\nnot normally be transported when these measures have not been taken, unless the item in question is listed \\nelsewhere (such as class 1) without any indication of, or with different, precautionary measures. \\nCertain substances , by the nature of their chemical composition , tend to polymerize or otherwise react in a \\ndangerous manner under certain conditions of temperature or in contact with a catalyst. Mitigation of this \\ntendency can be carried out either by requiring special transport conditions or by adding adequate amounts \\nof chemical inhibitors or stabilizers to the product. These products shall be sufficiently stabilized to prevent \\nany dangerous reaction during the intended voyage. If this cannot be ensured, the transport of such products \\nis prohibited. \\nWhere the contents of a portable tank is to be transported heated, the transport temperature is to be \\nmaintained during the intended voyage unless it is established that crystallization or solidification on cooling \\nwould not result in instability , which can occur with some stabilized or inhibited products. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18) 3', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 548}),\n",

Synonyms , secondary names, initials, abbreviations of names, etc. have been included in the Index t。\\nfacilitate the search for the proper shipping name (see part 5, Consignment procedures). \\nNote 2: For proper shipping names to be used for transport of samples, see 2.0.4. For proper shipping names \\nto be used for transport of wastes, see 5.4.1.4.3.3. \\nThe proper shipping name is that portion of the entry most accurately describing the goods in the Dangerous \\nGoods List, which is shown in upper-case characters (plus any numbers, Greek letters, ‘sec’, ‘tert’, and the \\nletters m, n, 0, p, which form an integral part of the name). An alternative proper shipping name may be shown \\nin brackets f이lowing the main proper shipping name (such as ETHANOL (ETHYL ALCOHOL)). Portions of an \\nentry appearing in lower case need not be considered as part of the proper shipping name but may be used. \\nWhen a combination of several distinct proper shipping names are listed under a single UN number, and \\nthese are separated by “and\" or “or\" in lower case or are punctuated by commas, only the most appropriate \\nshall be shown in the transport document and package marks. \\nExamples illustrating the selection of the proper shipping name for such entries are: \\n.1 UN 1057 LlGHTERS or LlGHTER REFILLS -The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the \\nfollowing possible combinations: \\nLlGHTERS \\nLlGHTER REFILLS: \\n.2 UN 2583 ALKYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLlD or ARYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLlD with more than 5% free \\nsulphuric acid -The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the following: \\nALKYLSULPHONIC ACIDS, SOLlD \\nARYLSULPHONIC ACIDS. SOLlD: \\n.3 UN 2793 FERROUS METAL BORINGS , SHAVINGS , TURNINGS or CUTTINGS in a form liable to \\nself-heating. The proper shipping name is the most appropriate of the following combinations: \\nFERROUS METAL BORINGS \\nFERROUS METAL SHAVINGS \\nFERROUS METAL TURNINGS \\nFERROUS METAL CUTTINGS. \\n3.1.2.3 Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural as appropriate . In addition , when qualifying words \\nare used as part of the proper shipping name, their sequence on documentation or packages is optional. \\nCommercial or military names for goods of class 1, which contain the proper shipping name supplemented \\nby additional text, may be used. \\n3.1.2.4 Many substances have an entry for both the liquid and solid state (see definitions for liquids and solids \\nin 1.2.1), or for the solid and solution. These are allocated separate UN numbers which are not necessarily \\nadjacent to each other. Details are provided in the alphabetical index, e.g.: \\nNITROXYLENES , LlQUID -6.1 1665 \\nNITROXYLENES , SOLlD -6.1 3447. \\n3.1.2.5 Where it is not already included , the qualifying word “MOLTEN\" shall be added to the proper shipping name \\nwhen a substance which is solid in accordance with the definition in 1.2.1 is offered for transport in the \\nmolten state (such as ALKYLPHENOL , SOLlD, N.O.S., MOLTEN). For elevated temperature substances , \\nsee 5.4.1.4.3.4. \\n3.1.2.6 Except for self-reactive substances and organic peroxides and unless it is already included in capitalletters in \\nthe name indicated in the Dangerous Goods List, the word STABILlZED shall be added as part of the proper \\nshipping name of the substance which without stabilization would be forbidden from transport in accordance \\nwith 1.1.3 due to it being liable to dangerously react under conditions normally encountered in transport \\n(such as TOXIC LlQUID, ORGANIC , N.O.S., STABILlZED). When temperature control is used to stabilize such \\nsubstances to prevent the development of any dangerous excess pressure, or the evolution of excessive \\nheat, or when chemical stabilization is used in combination with temperature control, then: \\n.1 For liquids and solids where the SAPT (measured without or with inhibitor, when chemical stabilization is \\napplied) is less than or equal to that prescribed in 2.4.2.5.2, special provision 386 of chapter 3.3 and the \\nprovisions of 7.3.7 apply; \\n6..2 Unless it is already included in capital letters in the name indicated in the Dangerous Goods List, the \\nwords “TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED\" shall be added as part of the proper shipping name. \\n6..3 For gases: the conditions of transport shall be approved by the competent authority. \\n3.1.2.7 Hydrates may be transported under the proper shipping name for the anhydrous substance. \\n4 IMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18)', metadata={'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf', 'page': 549}),\n",

Proper shipping names may be shown in plural where isomers of \\nsimilar classification exist. Hydrates may be included under the proper shipping name for the \\nanhydrous substances. Unless otherwise indicated for an entry in the Dangerous Goods List, \\nthe word “SOLUTION\" in a proper shipping name means one or more named dangerous goods \\ndissolved in a liquid that is not otherwise subject to this Code. When a flashpoint is mentioned \\nin this column, the data is based on closed-cup (c.c.) methods. \\nColumn 3 Class or division -this column contains the class and, in the case of class 1, the dívísion and \\nthe compatibility group assigned to the substance or article according to the classification \\nsystem described in part 2, chapter 2.1. \\n6. Column 4 Subsidiary hazard(s) -this column contains the class number(s) of any subsidiary hazard(s) \\nwhich have been identified by applying the classification system described in part 2. This \\ncolumn also identifies a dangerous good as a marine pollutant as follows: \\np -Marine pollutant: a non-exhaustive list of known marine pollutants , based on previous \\ncriteria and assignmen t. The absence of the symbol P or the presence of a “-\" in that \\ncolumn does not preclude the application of 2.10.3. \\nColumn 5 Packing group -this column contains the packing group number (i.e. 1, 11 or 111) where assigned \\nto the substance or article. If more than one packing group is indicated for the entry, the packing \\ngroup of the substance or formulation to be transported shall be determined , based on its \\nproperties , through application of the hazard grouping criteria as provided in part 2. \\nColumn 6 Special provisions -this column contains a number referring to any special provision(s) \\nindicated in chapter 3.3 that is relevant to the substance or article. Special provisions apply to \\n러1 packing groups permitted for a particular substance or article unless the wording makes it \\notherwise apparent. The special provision numbers specific to the sea mode start from 900. \\nNote: When a special provision is no longer needed, this special provision is deleted but the \\nspecial provision number is not allocated again, in order not to confuse the users of this Code. \\nFor this reason, some of the numbers are missing. \\nColumn 7a Limited quantities -this column provides the maximum quantity per inner packaging or article \\nfor transporting dangerous goods as limited quantities in accordance with chapter 3.4. \\nColumn 7b Excepted quantities -this column provides an alpha-numeric code described in subsection \\n3.5.1.2 which indicates the maximum quantity per inner and outer packaging for transporting \\ndangerous goods as excepted quantities in accordance with chapter 3.5. \\nColumn 8 Packing instructions -this column contains alpha-numeric codes which refer to the relevant \\npacking instruction(s) in 4.1.4.

There are no degradability and bioaccumulation data for mixtures as a whole. \\nDegradability and bioaccumulation tests for mixtures are not used as they are usually difficult to interpret, \\nand such tests may be meaningful only for single substances. \\n2.9.3.4.3.3 C/assification for category Acute 1 \\n(a) When there are adequate acute toxicity test data (LC50 or EC50) available for the mixture as a whole \\nshowing L(E)C50 ~ 1 mg/L: \\nClassify the mixture as Acute 1 in accordance with table 2.9.1 (a); \\n(b) When there are acute toxicity test data (LC50(s) or EC50(s) available for the mixture as a whole showing \\nL(E)C50(s) > 1 mg/L, or above the water solubility: \\nNo need to classify for acute hazard under these Regulations. \\n2.9.3.4.3.4 C/assification for categories Chronic 1 and 2 \\n(a) When there are adequate chronic toxicity data (ECx or NOEC) available for the mixture as a whole showing \\nECx or NOEC of the tested mixture ~ 1 mg/L: \\n(i) classify the mixture as Chronic 1 or 2 in accordance with table 2.9.1 (b)(ii) (rapidly degradable) if the \\navailable information allows the conclusion that all relevant ingredients of the mixture are rapidly \\ndegradable; \\n(ii) classify the mixture as Chronic 1 or 2 in all other cases in accordance with table 2.9.1 (b)(i) (non-rapidly \\ndegradable); \\n(b) When there are adequate chronic toxicity data (ECx or NOEC) available for the mixture as a whole showing \\nECx(s) or NOEC(s) of the tested mixture > 1 mg/L or above the water solubility: \\nNo need to classify for long-term hazard under these Regulations. \\n2.9.3.4.4 Classi ηcatíon of míxtures when toxicity data are not available \\nfor the complete mixture: bridging principles \\n2.9.3.4.4.1 Where the mixture itself has not been tested to determine its aquatic environmental hazard, but there are \\nsufficient data on the individual ingredients and similar tested mixtures to adequately characterize the hazards \\n。fthe mixture, these data shall be used in accordance with the following agreed bridging rules. This ensures \\nthat the classification process uses the available data to the greatest extent possible in characterizing the \\nhazards of the mixture without the necessity for additional testing in animals. \\n2.9.3.4.4.2 Dilution \\n2.9.3.4.4.2.1 Where a new mixture is formed by diluting a tested mixture or a substance with a diluent which has an \\nequivalent or lower aquatic hazard classification than the least toxic original ingredient and which is not \\nexpected to affect the aquatic hazards of other ingredients , then the resulting mixture shall be classified as \\nequivalent to the original tested mixture or substance. Alternatively , the method explained in 2.9.3.4.5 may be \\napplied. \\n2.9.3.4.4.2.2 If a mixture is formed by diluting another classified mixture or a substance with water or other totally non-toxic \\nmaterial, the toxicity of the mixture shall be calculated from the original mixture or substance. \\n2.9.3.4.4.3 Batching \\n2.9.3.4.4.3.1 The aquatic hazard classification of a tested production batch of a mixture shall be assumed to be substantially \\nequivalent to that of another untested production batch of the same commercial product when produced by \\n。runder the control of the same manufacturer , unless there is reason to believe there is significant variation \\nsuch that the aquatic hazard classification of the untested batch has changed. If the latter occurs, new \\nclassification is necessary. \\n2.9.3.4.4.4 Concentration of mixtures which are classified with the most severe classification categories \\n(Chronic 1 and Acute 1) \\n2.9.3.4.4.4.1 If a tested mixture is classified as Chronic 1 and/or Acute 1, and the ingredients of the mixture which are \\nclassified as Chronic 1 and/or Acute 1 are further concentrated , the more concentrated untested mixture shall \\nbe classified with the same classification category as the original tested mixture without additional testing. \\nIMDG Code (incorporating amendment 39-18) 139', metadata={'page': 151, 'source': '/Users/kenny_jung/Documents/GitHub/IMDG.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Chapter 2.0 -Introduction \\nClass and 4.2 4.3 5.1 5.1 5.1 6.1,1 6.1,1 6.1 6.1 8,1 8,1 8, 11 8, 11 8.111 8,111 \\nPacking Group 11 111 Oermal Oral 11 111 Liquid Solid Liquid Solid Liquid Solid \\n4.3 111 5.1 5.1 4.3 6.1 6.1 6.1 4.3 8 8 8 8 4.3 4.3 \\n5.1 1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 \\n5.1 11 6.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 8 8 5.1 5.1 5.1 5.1 \\n5.1 111 6.1 6.1 6.1 5‘1 8 8 8 8 5.1 5.1 \\n6.1 1, Oermal 8 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 \\n6.1 I,Oral 8 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 6‘1 \\n6.1 11, Inhalation 8 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 6.1 \\n6.1 II,Oermal 8 6.1 8 6.1 6.1 \\n6.1 II,Oral 8 8 8 6.1 6.1 \\n6.1 111 8 8 8 8 8 \\n• Substances of class 4.1 other than self-reactive substances and solid desensitized explosives and substances of \\nclass 3 other than liquid desensitized explosives. \\n\\x9d 6.1 for pesticides. \\n-Oenotes an impossible combination. \\nFor hazards not shown in this table, see 2.0.3.4 and 2.0.3.5. \\n2.0.4 Transport of samples \\n2.0.4.1 When the hazard class of a substance is uncertain and it is being transported for further testing, a tentative \\nhazard class, proper shipping name and identification number shall be assigned on the basis of the consígnor ’s \\nknowledge of the substances and application of: \\n.1 the classifícation criteria of this Code: and \\n.2 the precedence of hazards given in 2.0.3. \\nThe most severe packing group possible for the proper shipping name chosen shall be used. \\nWhere this provision is used, the proper shipping name shall be supplemented with the word “SAMPLE\" (such \\nas FLAMMABLE UQUID, N.O.S., SAMPL 티.

The classification is \\nnormally based on the data for fish, crustacea and algae/plants (see 2.9.3.2.3 and 2.9.3.2.4). When adequate \\nacute or chronic data for the mixture as a whole are lacking, “bridging principles\" or “summation method\" \\nshall be applied (see 2.9.3.4.4 to 2.9.3.4.6). \\n2.9.3.4.3.2 The long-term hazard classification of mixtures requires additional information on degradability and in certain \\ncases bioaccumulation.

    "Marine pollutants are substances that pose a risk to the marine environment and human health when transported by sea. These substances are classified as dangerous goods under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code. Here is some detailed information about marine pollutants:\n",
    "Definition: Marine pollutants are substances that are harmful to the marine environment. They can be solid, liquid, or gaseous and are classified based on their properties and potential hazards.\n",
    "Classification: Marine pollutants are classified into different categories based on their properties and potential risks. These categories help in identifying the appropriate handling, stowage, and segregation requirements during transportation.\n",
    "Regulations: The transport of marine pollutants is regulated by international agreements and conventions to ensure the safety of marine ecosystems and human health. The IMDG Code provides guidelines for the safe transport of dangerous goods, including marine pollutants, by sea.\n",
    "Handling and Stowage: Proper handling and stowage of marine pollutants are crucial to prevent accidents, spills, and contamination of the marine environment. Specific instructions and provisions are outlined in the IMDG Code to ensure safe transportation.\n",
    "Segregation: Segregation requirements are important to prevent incompatible substances from coming into contact with each other during transport. Segregation rules help minimize the risk of chemical reactions or accidents that could harm the marine environment.\n",
    "Emergency Response: In case of spills or accidents involving marine pollutants, emergency response procedures must be followed to contain the spill, minimize environmental damage, and protect human health. Proper training and equipment are essential for effective emergency response.\n",
    "Documentation: Proper documentation and labeling of marine pollutants are necessary for identification, handling, and emergency response. Clear labeling and accurate documentation help ensure that the substances are handled safely throughout the transportation process.\n",
    "Compliance: It is essential for all parties involved in the transport of marine pollutants to comply with the regulations and guidelines set forth in the IMDG Code and other relevant international standards. Compliance helps prevent accidents and protect the marine environment.\n",
    "Overall, the safe transport of marine pollutants is crucial to prevent environmental pollution and ensure the sustainability of marine ecosystems. Adhering to regulations, following proper handling procedures, and being prepared for emergencies are key aspects of transporting marine pollutants safely.\n",
