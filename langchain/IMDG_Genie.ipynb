Carriage of marine pollutants is primarily regulated to prevent harm to the marine \\nenvironmen t. The objective of the IMDG Code is to enhance the safe carriage of dangerous goods while \\nfacilitating the free unrestricted movement of such goods and prevent p이lution to the environmen t. \\n2 Over the years, many maritime countries have taken measures to regulate the transport of dangerous goods \\nby sea. The various regulations , codes and practices , however, differed in their framework and, in particular , \\nin the identification and labelling of such goods. 80th the terminology used and the provisions for packaging \\nand stowage varied from country to country and created difficulties for all directly or indirectly concerned with \\nthe transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\n3 The need for international regulation of the transport of dangerous goods by sea was recognized by the 1929 \\nInternational Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which recommended that rules on the subject \\nhave international effect. The classification of dangerous goods and certain general provisions concerning \\ntheir transport in ships were adopted by the 1948 SOLAS Conference. This Conference also recommended \\nfurther study with the object of developing international regulations. \\n4 Meanwhile, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations had appointed an ad hoc Committee \\n。fExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Committee of Experts), which had been actively \\nconsidering the international aspect of the transport of dangerous goods by all modes of transport. This \\ncommittee completed a report in 1956 dealing with classification , listing and labelling of dangerous goods \\nand with the transport documents required for such goods. This report, with subsequent modifications , \\noffered a general framework to which existing regulations could be harmonized and within which they could \\nbe further developed. The primary goal being world-wide uniformity for regulations concerning the transport \\nof dangerous goods by sea as well as other modes of transport. \\n5 As a further step towards meeting the need for international rules governing the transport of dangerous \\ngoods in ships, the 1960 SOLAS Conference , in addition to laying down a general framework of provisions \\nin chapter VII of the SOLAS Convention , invited IMO (Recommendation 56) to undertake a study with a view \\nto establishing a unified international code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea. This study would \\nbe pursued in cooperation with the UN Committee of Experts and should take account of existing maritime \\npractices and procedures. The Conference further recommended that the unified code be prepared by IMO \\nand that it be adopted by the Governments that were Parties to the 1960 Convention. \\n6 To implement Recommendation 56, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) appointed a working group \\ndrawn from those countries having considerable experience in the transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\nPreliminary drafts for each class of substances , materials and articles were subsequently brought under \\nclose scrutiny by the working group to take into account throughout the practices and procedures of a number \\n。fmaritime countries in order to make the Code as widely acceptable as possible. This new International \\nMaritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code was approved by the MSC and recommended to Governments by \\nthe Assembly of IMO in 1965. \\n7 During anotherSOLAS Conference held in 1974, chapterVl1 ofthe Convention remained essentially unchanged. \\nSince that date, several amendments to chapter VII adopted by the MSC have entered into force. Although \\ninvoked by a footnote reference in regulation 1 of chapter VII, the IMDG Code itself had only recommendatory \\nstatus until 31 December 2003. \\n8 At the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973, the need was recognized to preserve the marine \\nenvironmen t. It was further recognized that negligent or accidental release of marine pollutants transported \\nby sea in packaged form should be minimized. Consequently , provisions were established and adopted by \\nthe Conference , and are contained in Annex 111 of the Internationa l Convention for the Prevention of Pollution \\nfrom Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPO 니. The Marine Environment \\nProtection Committee (MEPC) decided in 1985 that Annex 111 should be implemented through the IMDG Code. \\nThis decision was also endorsed by the MSC in 1985.

Carriage of marine pollutants is primarily regulated to prevent harm to the marine \\nenvironmen t. The objective of the IMDG Code is to enhance the safe carriage of dangerous goods while \\nfacilitating the free unrestricted movement of such goods and prevent p이lution to the environmen t. \\n2 Over the years, many maritime countries have taken measures to regulate the transport of dangerous goods \\nby sea. The various regulations , codes and practices , however, differed in their framework and, in particular , \\nin the identification and labelling of such goods. 80th the terminology used and the provisions for packaging \\nand stowage varied from country to country and created difficulties for all directly or indirectly concerned with \\nthe transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\n3 The need for international regulation of the transport of dangerous goods by sea was recognized by the 1929 \\nInternational Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which recommended that rules on the subject \\nhave international effect. The classification of dangerous goods and certain general provisions concerning \\ntheir transport in ships were adopted by the 1948 SOLAS Conference. This Conference also recommended \\nfurther study with the object of developing international regulations. \\n4 Meanwhile, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations had appointed an ad hoc Committee \\n。fExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Committee of Experts), which had been actively \\nconsidering the international aspect of the transport of dangerous goods by all modes of transport. This \\ncommittee completed a report in 1956 dealing with classification , listing and labelling of dangerous goods \\nand with the transport documents required for such goods. This report, with subsequent modifications , \\noffered a general framework to which existing regulations could be harmonized and within which they could \\nbe further developed. The primary goal being world-wide uniformity for regulations concerning the transport \\nof dangerous goods by sea as well as other modes of transport. \\n5 As a further step towards meeting the need for international rules governing the transport of dangerous \\ngoods in ships, the 1960 SOLAS Conference , in addition to laying down a general framework of provisions \\nin chapter VII of the SOLAS Convention , invited IMO (Recommendation 56) to undertake a study with a view \\nto establishing a unified international code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea. This study would \\nbe pursued in cooperation with the UN Committee of Experts and should take account of existing maritime \\npractices and procedures. The Conference further recommended that the unified code be prepared by IMO \\nand that it be adopted by the Governments that were Parties to the 1960 Convention. \\n6 To implement Recommendation 56, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) appointed a working group \\ndrawn from those countries having considerable experience in the transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\nPreliminary drafts for each class of substances , materials and articles were subsequently brought under \\nclose scrutiny by the working group to take into account throughout the practices and procedures of a number \\n。fmaritime countries in order to make the Code as widely acceptable as possible. This new International \\nMaritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code was approved by the MSC and recommended to Governments by \\nthe Assembly of IMO in 1965. \\n7 During anotherSOLAS Conference held in 1974, chapterVl1 ofthe Convention remained essentially unchanged. \\nSince that date, several amendments to chapter VII adopted by the MSC have entered into force. Although \\ninvoked by a footnote reference in regulation 1 of chapter VII, the IMDG Code itself had only recommendatory \\nstatus until 31 December 2003. \\n8 At the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973, the need was recognized to preserve the marine \\nenvironmen t. It was further recognized that negligent or accidental release of marine pollutants transported \\nby sea in packaged form should be minimized. Consequently , provisions were established and adopted by \\nthe Conference , and are contained in Annex 111 of the Internationa l Convention for the Prevention of Pollution \\nfrom Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPO 니. The Marine Environment \\nProtection Committee (MEPC) decided in 1985 that Annex 111 should be implemented through the IMDG Code. \\nThis decision was also endorsed by the MSC in 1985.

Carriage of marine pollutants is primarily regulated to prevent harm to the marine \\nenvironmen t. The objective of the IMDG Code is to enhance the safe carriage of dangerous goods while \\nfacilitating the free unrestricted movement of such goods and prevent p이lution to the environmen t. \\n2 Over the years, many maritime countries have taken measures to regulate the transport of dangerous goods \\nby sea. The various regulations , codes and practices , however, differed in their framework and, in particular , \\nin the identification and labelling of such goods. 80th the terminology used and the provisions for packaging \\nand stowage varied from country to country and created difficulties for all directly or indirectly concerned with \\nthe transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\n3 The need for international regulation of the transport of dangerous goods by sea was recognized by the 1929 \\nInternational Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which recommended that rules on the subject \\nhave international effect. The classification of dangerous goods and certain general provisions concerning \\ntheir transport in ships were adopted by the 1948 SOLAS Conference. This Conference also recommended \\nfurther study with the object of developing international regulations. \\n4 Meanwhile, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations had appointed an ad hoc Committee \\n。fExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Committee of Experts), which had been actively \\nconsidering the international aspect of the transport of dangerous goods by all modes of transport. This \\ncommittee completed a report in 1956 dealing with classification , listing and labelling of dangerous goods \\nand with the transport documents required for such goods. This report, with subsequent modifications , \\noffered a general framework to which existing regulations could be harmonized and within which they could \\nbe further developed. The primary goal being world-wide uniformity for regulations concerning the transport \\nof dangerous goods by sea as well as other modes of transport. \\n5 As a further step towards meeting the need for international rules governing the transport of dangerous \\ngoods in ships, the 1960 SOLAS Conference , in addition to laying down a general framework of provisions \\nin chapter VII of the SOLAS Convention , invited IMO (Recommendation 56) to undertake a study with a view \\nto establishing a unified international code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea. This study would \\nbe pursued in cooperation with the UN Committee of Experts and should take account of existing maritime \\npractices and procedures. The Conference further recommended that the unified code be prepared by IMO \\nand that it be adopted by the Governments that were Parties to the 1960 Convention. \\n6 To implement Recommendation 56, IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) appointed a working group \\ndrawn from those countries having considerable experience in the transport of dangerous goods by sea. \\nPreliminary drafts for each class of substances , materials and articles were subsequently brought under \\nclose scrutiny by the working group to take into account throughout the practices and procedures of a number \\n。fmaritime countries in order to make the Code as widely acceptable as possible. This new International \\nMaritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code was approved by the MSC and recommended to Governments by \\nthe Assembly of IMO in 1965. \\n7 During anotherSOLAS Conference held in 1974, chapterVl1 ofthe Convention remained essentially unchanged. \\nSince that date, several amendments to chapter VII adopted by the MSC have entered into force. Although \\ninvoked by a footnote reference in regulation 1 of chapter VII, the IMDG Code itself had only recommendatory \\nstatus until 31 December 2003. \\n8 At the International Conference on Marine Pollution, 1973, the need was recognized to preserve the marine \\nenvironmen t. It was further recognized that negligent or accidental release of marine pollutants transported \\nby sea in packaged form should be minimized. Consequently , provisions were established and adopted by \\nthe Conference , and are contained in Annex 111 of the Internationa l Convention for the Prevention of Pollution \\nfrom Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPO 니. The Marine Environment \\nProtection Committee (MEPC) decided in 1985 that Annex 111 should be implemented through the IMDG Code. \\nThis decision was also endorsed by the MSC in 1985.
